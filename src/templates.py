[Input]
Given the following incomplete plan to make an onlette
1) Gather all necessary ingredients, including eggs, butter or oil, salt and pepper, cheese (optional), and any other desired fillings such as vegetables or meat.
2) Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk them together until the yolks are broken up. 
3) Add in the butter or oil to the egg mixture and continue to whisk until it is well combined.
4) Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Analyze the following 3 statements in terms of correctness and plausibility as a next step in the above plan:
[1] Use a spatula to gently lift one side of the omelette up towards the center so that the uncooked eggs can flow underneath. Repeat this process every few minutes as you continue to cook the egg mixture until it is mostly set but still slightly runny on top.
[2] Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add enough butter or oil to coat the bottom of the pan. 
[3] Once the butter has melted, pour in the egg mixture and let it cook for about 30 seconds until it starts to set on the edges.
Output the number of the best statement.
